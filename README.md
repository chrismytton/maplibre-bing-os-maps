# Maplibre Bing OS Maps

> **⚠️ ARCHIVED**: This repository has been archived because Microsoft discontinued Bing Maps for Enterprise Basic (free) accounts on June 30, 2025. The Ordnance Survey maps layer that this demo relied on is no longer publicly accessible without a paid enterprise account. Microsoft is transitioning mapping services to Azure Maps. For more information, see the [Bing Maps retirement announcement](https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2025-06/Bing-Maps-for-Enterprise-Basic-Account-shutdown-June-30,2025).
